# Hi, I'm Nikhilesh! ðŸ‘‹

This ecommerce MERN app built with Next.js has been a rewarding journey that strengthened my understanding of application architecture and enhanced my creativity in problem-solving. From frontend UI design to backend API development, the process offered invaluable hands-on experience adapting to real-world project demands.

The biggest challenge was grasping the overall flow, execution, and result of the code. I realized that success isnâ€™t just about writing codeâ€”itâ€™s about the logic and structure behind it.
